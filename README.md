# Wine Quality Prediction 🍷

Welcome to **Wine Quality Prediction**! This project aims to analyze and predict the quality of wine based on various attributes using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality Dataset from Kaggle.

## Overview

The project is structured as follows:
1. Data Exploration and Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building and Evaluation
4. Feature Importance
5. Prediction

## Data Exploration and Analysis 📊

### Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle Wine Quality Dataset
- **Features**: Various chemical properties of wines
- **Target**: Quality of the wine

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loading the dataset
- Checking for missing values
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships

## Data Preprocessing 🛠️

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature Scaling

## Model Building and Evaluation 🤖

We experimented with multiple classification algorithms to predict wine quality:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## Feature Importance 📈

We analyzed the feature importance using the Random Forest Classifier to understand which chemical properties have the most significant impact on wine quality.

## Prediction 🎯

We performed predictions on a sample test data to demonstrate how the model can be used in real-world scenarios.

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Setup Instructions 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`.
