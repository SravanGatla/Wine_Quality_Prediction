# Wine_Quality_Prediction

Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualization, and Data Analysis to Predict Red Wine Quality.

## Description

### Context

The two datasets contain physicochemical and sensory data for red and white variant wines from the Portuguese Vinho Verde region. As referenced in Cortez et al., 2009, due to privacy and logistical considerations, information beyond physicochemical inputs and sensory outputs was not available (e.g., grape varietals, brands, prices). 
The datasets can be modeled as either classification tasks predicting quality scores or regression tasks predicting continuous quality ratings. The classification labels represent ordered imbalanced classes, with many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones. The data is also hosted on the UCI machine learning repository for public access, though it has been shared here to provide more accessible options for experimentation. This is believed to comply with license terms, but the datasets will be removed if unauthorized based on rights holder requests.
